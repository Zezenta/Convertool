    <p1>Test text:
      The golden gate bridge is about 1.7 miles long.<br>
      It also could be expressed as 1,280.2 m long.<br>
      In feet, it could also be expressed as 8,980 ft.<br>
      If we want to convert it to miles, it would be expressed as 1.7 mi.<br>
      This text makes no sense whatsoever, but I need it for testing purposes.</p1>
